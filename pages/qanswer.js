              I would like some information about the Islamic ruling on looking
              at the girl, when a young man proposes marriage: what is the
              ruling on that, and what has been narrated concerning it of verses
              and hadiths? Why was it prescribed, and what is the wisdom behind
              it? What should the young man ask the girl? For example: your
              future ambitions, your aim in life, your understanding of the
              concept of marriage; and various issues such as the ruling on
              seeing her more than once, how serious the man should be about
              marriage, and how long he should see her for – should it be half
              an hour, or an hour? What is the Islamic ruling on that? Is it
              permissible to do that or not, and what is permitted and what is
              forbidden? Can the man sit near her, and can they be next to one
              another? What part of her body can the woman uncover? I would like
              references and names of useful Islamic books that speak about this
              topic, even if it is only in a few chapters. And for the girl,
              what is required of her? Should she look natural or adorn herself
              lightly, without going to too much trouble or adding some cosmetic
              details that change her appearance?

          The Messenger (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) instructed
          the one who wants to propose marriage to a woman to look at her, and
          he described that as one of the means of creating affection between
          them. <br /> <br />
          At-Tirmidhi (1087) and Ibn Maajah (1865) narrated from al-Mugheerah
          ibn Shu‘bah (may Allah be pleased with him) that he proposed to a
          woman, and the Prophet (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him)
          said: “Go and look at her, for that is more likely to create affection
          between you” meaning that it is more likely to create lasting
          affection between you. This hadith was classed as sahih by al-Albani
          in Sahih at-Tirmidhi. <br /> <br />
          Abu Dawud (2082) narrated that Jabir ibn ‘Abdillah (may Allah be pleased with him) said: The Messenger of Allah (blessings and peace of Allah be upon him) said: “When one of you proposes to a woman, if he is able to see of her that which would encourage him to go ahead and marry her, then let him do so.” Classed as hasan by al-Albani in Sahih Abi Dawud. <br /><br />
