                        <p className="pb-4">Islam Q&A is an academic, educational, da‘wah website which aims to offer advice and academic answers based on evidence from religious texts in an adequate and easy-to-understand manner. These answers are supervised by Shaykh Muhammad Saalih al-Munajjid (may Allah preserve him). The website welcomes questions from everyone, Muslims and otherwise, about Islamic, psychological and social matters.</p>
                        <p className=" font-bold pb-4 text-green-700">Aims:</p>
                        <p className="px-2 pb-4">1. To spread Islam and call people to it. <br></br>
                            2. To spread Islamic knowledge and dispel ignorance among Muslims.<br></br>
                            3. To respond to people’s needs by offering advice and answers based on evidence from religious texts.<br></br>
                            5. To refute the specious arguments of doubters about Islam.<br></br>
                            6. To advise people concerning day-to-day issues, by giving educational, academic advice about social and other matters.</p>
                        <p className=" font-bold pb-4 text-green-700">Methodology:</p>
                        <p className="pb-4">The website promotes the ‘aqeedah (beliefs) of Ahl as-Sunnah wa’l-Jamaa‘ah and the followers of the righteous early generations of Islam (as-salaf as-saalih). It strives to ensure that the answers are based on evidence from the Holy Qur’an and the soundly-narrated (saheeh) prophetic Sunnah, and are taken from the writings of the scholars, including the imams of the four madhhabs, Imam Abu Haneefah, Imam Maalik, Imam ash-Shaafa‘i and Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal, as well as other earlier and later scholars, and from the statements of fiqh councils and seekers of knowledge who  conduct research in various Islamic specialties. <br></br>
                            The website avoids getting involved in issues that are of no benefit, such as empty arguments, trading insults and fruitless debates. <br></br>
                            O Allah, we ask You to make us steadfast in adhering to the path of guidance, and to help us to do that which You love and are pleased with.</p>
